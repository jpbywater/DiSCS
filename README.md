# DiSCS
The Differential Segmentation of Categorical Sequences (DiSCS) algorithm 

DiSCS is a machine-learning algorithm takes a categorial sequence and splits it into segments so that each of the segments is as different from its immediate neighbors as possible. In effect, it finds the most distinct segments within a sequence of categories.

See DiSCSfunctions.py for functions. Documentation coing soon.
